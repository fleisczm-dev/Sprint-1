                    <h2>Will AI replace human jobs?</h2>
                </hgroup>
                <p>	While not all jobs will be fully replaced by AI some will be significantly altered. AI is a great tool for repetitive or straightforward tasks however it can't think for itself humans will have to be there to fact check. AI is also opening doors for new jobs in AI development and machine learning. </p>
                <h2>How does AI enhance productivity?</h2>
                <p>AI can be useful for many things, including repetitive tasks. AI can speed up the process by taking previous work and duplicating it in the blink of an eye. This will speed up productivity and leave more time in the day for further progression in more creative aspects.
	Something AI is really good at is forecasting. It's able to predict future results to help businesses prepare and properly allocate resources.
</p>
           <h2>Can AI make mistakes?</h2>
           <p>Yes, AI makes mistakes all the time. AI is just a computer and doesn't have a brain for itself. Just like human communication, things can get lost in translation. AI can misunderstand things from both the user and the sources it gets its “information” from. AI takes other online resources that have been published before compiling them together and making its own summary. If what has been published before is wrong, AI won't know that.</p>
           <h2>How important is human oversight?</h2>
           <p>Human oversight is very important when it comes to the use of AI. AI is never guaranteed to be correct therefore humans must check its work. AI can be biased resulting in unethical results. AI should be used as a tool for repetitive tasks or clearing up confusion rather than a short cut for doing all the work.
